**ï»¿Ansible Security Hardening Playbooks**
---
This repository provides a collection of Ansible playbooks designed to enhance the security posture of Linux servers by automating the implementation of security best practices.


**Installation**

First, install Ansible on your control machine. The installation method varies depending on your operating system.

Ubuntu/Debian:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt install -y ansible
```

CentOS/RHEL:
```
sudo yum install -y epel-release
sudo yum install -y ansible
```

For other operating systems or more detailed instructions, please refer to the official Ansible installation guide.

**Inventory Setup**

The inventory file (inventory.ini) is where you define the hosts that Ansible will manage. Create or modify the inventory.ini file to match your environment.

Example `inventory.ini`:
```
[prod_servers] #the nameof your servers group
# Format: <hostname> ansible_host=<ip_address> ansible_user=<ssh_user> ansible_private_key_file=<path_to_ssh_key>
server1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10 ansible_user=admin ansible_private_key_file=~/.ssh/prod_key

[my_machine] #localhost
localhost ansible_connection=local ansible_become=true
```
* [prod_servers]: A group of remote servers.
* [my_machine]: The local machine where Ansible is running.
* Replace the placeholder values with your actual server details.

**Running a Playbook**
To execute a playbook, use the ansible-playbook command from the root of this repository.

Command Syntax:
```
ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> <playbook_file>
```

Example:
To apply the SSH `hardening playbook` to the servers defined in your inventory.ini:
```
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini 01_ssh_hardening.yml
```

Available Playbooks
Here is a list of the playbooks included in this repository:
* 01_ssh_hardening.yml: Applies fundamental security hardening to the SSH service.
* file_system.yml: Implements security measures for the filesystem.
* firewall_hardening.yml: Configures and hardens the UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall).
* network_parameter.yml: Hardens kernel network parameters.
* service_hardening.yml: Disables and removes insecure services.
* ssh.yml: Contains additional, more specific SSH hardening configurations.
  
**Auditing with CIS-CAT**
---
To verify the effectiveness of these playbooks and assess your system's compliance with security benchmarks, you can use the CIS-CAT (Configuration Assessment Tool).
**Downloading CIS-CAT**
1. Navigate to the CIS-CAT Lite download page.
2. Complete the registration form to get access to the download link.
3. Download the tool for your specific operating system.

**Running a Scan**
1. Extract the downloaded archive.
2. Change into the extracted directory.
3. Execute the appropriate script to start a scan.

Example for Linux:
This command runs an assessment against the CIS Benchmark for Ubuntu 20.04 and saves the report in the reports directory.
```
./CIS-CAT.sh -b benchmarks/CIS_Ubuntu_Linux_20.04_LTS_Benchmark_v1.1.0-xccdf.xml -r ./reports -a
```
